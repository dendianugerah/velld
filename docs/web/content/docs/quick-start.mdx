# Quick Start

Get up and running with your first database backup in just a few minutes.

<Callout type="info">
  This guide assumes you've already [installed Velld](/docs/installation). If not, start there first.

## Your First Backup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Access the Dashboard

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and create your account.

    The dashboard gives you an overview of all your backups, success rates, and storage usage.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add a Database Connection

    1. Navigate to **Connections** in the sidebar
    2. Click **Add Connection**
    3. Fill in your database details:

    ```yaml
    Name: My Production DB
    Type: PostgreSQL
    Host: host.docker.internal
    Port: 5432
    Database: myapp_production
    Username: postgres
    Password: ••••••••
    ```

    <Callout type="tip">
      Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` to connect to databases running on your host machine.
    </Callout>

    **For remote databases behind a firewall:**

    Expand the **SSH Tunnel** section and enable it:

    ```yaml
    SSH Enabled: ✅
    SSH Host: bastion.example.com
    SSH Port: 22
    SSH Username: deploy
    SSH Auth Method: Private Key or Password
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
      SSH tunnels provide secure access to databases that don't allow direct external connections. See [Database Configuration](/docs/databases#ssh-tunnel-support) for details.
    </Callout>

    4. Click **Test Connection** to verify it works
    5. Click **Save Connection**
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Run Your First Backup

    From the Connections page:

    1. Find your newly created connection
    2. Click **Backup Now**
    3. Watch the backup progress in real-time

    Your backup will appear in the **History** page once complete!
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Schedule Automatic Backups

    Never miss a backup again:

    1. Go to **Connections**
    2. Click the **Schedule** icon on your connection
    3. Choose your backup frequency:
       - **Hourly** - Every hour
       - **Daily** - Once per day at a specific time
       - **Weekly** - Once per week
       - **Monthly** - Once per month
       - **Custom** - Use a cron expression

    Example schedules:
    ```bash
    # Every day at 2 AM
    0 2 * * *

    # Every 6 hours
    0 */6 * * *

    # Every Sunday at midnight
    0 0 * * 0
    ```

    4. Set retention policy (optional):
       - Keep backups for 7, 14, 30, or 90 days
       - Older backups are automatically deleted

    5. Click **Save Schedule**

    <Callout type="success">
      Your backups will now run automatically! You'll receive notifications for each backup.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Download or Compare Backups

    From the **History** page:

    **Download a backup:**
    - Click the download icon next to any backup
    - The backup file will download to your computer

    **Compare two backups:**
    - Click **Compare Backups** or click the compare icon on any backup
    - Select two backups to compare
    - View a detailed diff showing what changed between them

    <Callout type="tip">
      The compare feature is perfect for tracking schema changes or data migrations!
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Use Cases

### Production Database Backups

Schedule daily backups with 30-day retention:

```yaml
Connection: production-db
Schedule: 0 2 * * * (Daily at 2 AM)
Retention: 30 days
Notifications: ✓ Email on failure
```

### Development Database Snapshots

Run on-demand backups before migrations:

```yaml
Connection: dev-db
Schedule: Manual only
Retention: 7 days
Notifications: None
```

### Multi-Database Setup

Backup all your databases with different schedules:

```yaml
PostgreSQL (Main DB):
  Schedule: 0 */6 * * * (Every 6 hours)
  Retention: 14 days

MySQL (Analytics):
  Schedule: 0 3 * * * (Daily at 3 AM)
  Retention: 30 days

MongoDB (Sessions):
  Schedule: 0 */12 * * * (Every 12 hours)
  Retention: 7 days
```

## Pro Tips

### 1. Test Your Backups
Don't just create backups—test them! Download a backup and try restoring it to a test database.

### 2. Use Descriptive Names
Name your connections clearly:
- ✅ `production-postgres-main`
- ✅ `staging-mysql-analytics`
- ❌ `database1`
- ❌ `db`

### 3. Set Up Email Notifications
Get alerted when backups fail:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Notifications**
2. Enable email notifications
3. Configure your SMTP settings
4. Choose notification preferences (failures only, all backups, etc.)

### 4. Monitor Your Storage
Keep an eye on the **Storage Used** metric on the dashboard. Set up retention policies to automatically clean up old backups.

### 5. Use Connection Groups
If you have many databases, organize them by environment:
- `prod-*` for production
- `staging-*` for staging
- `dev-*` for development

## Restoring a Backup

<Callout type="warning">
  Always restore to an empty database. See [Restore Best Practices](/docs/restore-best-practices).
</Callout>

### Using Velld UI

1. Go to **History** page
2. Click **Restore** on your backup
3. Select target database (must be empty)
4. Confirm

**For production:** Create new database → Restore → Test → Switch app connection.

### Manual Restoration

#### PostgreSQL
```bash
createdb myapp_new
psql -U postgres -d myapp_new < backup.sql
```

#### MySQL
```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE myapp_new;"
mysql -u root -p myapp_new < backup.sql
```

#### MSSQL
```bash
# Restore from backup file
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P 'YourPassword' -Q "RESTORE DATABASE myapp_new FROM DISK = N'/path/to/backup.bak' WITH REPLACE"
```

#### MongoDB
```bash
mongorestore --archive=backup.archive --gzip
```
